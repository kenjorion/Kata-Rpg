# Kata-Rpg

# First iteration: Characters
A Character should have a name and a health pool.
A Character's health is initialized at 100 and cannot go above this value.
A Character can either be alive or dead - when it reaches 0 health points.
A Character can attack another Character and deal 1 damage point to its enemy's health if it isn't already dead. A Character cannot attack itself...
A Character can heal another Character and return 1 point to its ally's health pool. A Character can heal itself!

# Second iteration: Warrior
A Warrior is a Character that deals between 0 and 9 damage points to its enemy's health! Moreover, a Warrior can attack itself...
A Warrior can only heal itself.

# Third iteration: Priest
A Priest is a Character that cannot deal any damage.
A Priest can heal another Character and return between 5 and 10 points to its ally's health pool.
From now on, a Character cannot exist without a job.

# Fourth iteration: Factions 
A Character may now belong to a Faction!
A newly created Character doesn't belong to any Faction.
A Faction should have a name
A Character can join a Faction.
A Character can leave its Faction.
A Character cannot deal damage to another Character of the same Faction.
A Character can only heal another Character of the same Faction.

# Fifth iteration: Entities
A Character can now damage non-character entities.
Anything that has health is considered an Entity.
An Entity cannot deal damage and cannot heal nor be healed.
An Entity cannot belong to a Faction.

# Sixth iteration: Factions 
A Faction may now declare one or more Factions as friends.
A Character cannot deal damage to another Character of the same Faction or of one of its friends.
A Character can only heal another Character of the same Faction or of one of its friends.

# Seventh iteration: Factions 
A Character may now belong to one or more Factions.

# Eighth iteration: Assemblies 
A Character can now belong to an Assembly
An Assembly works like a Faction with two differences :
An Assembly has a list of allowedRoles that defines what classes can join the assembly
A Character can only join one Assembly at a time, which means he has to leave an Assembly before he joins a new one.

# Nineth iteration: Assemblies
An Assembly should have a master, which is the first Character to join the Assembly.
The master is the only one allowed to update the Assembly name.
When the master leaves an Assembly, another random master is automatically selected
